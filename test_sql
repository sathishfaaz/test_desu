Find the second highest salary in each department.

 SELECT name,dept.name, max(salary)
from employees  as emp
inner join on  departments  as dep dep.department_id =emp.department_id 
where salary < (SELECT  max(salary) from employees

2)Calculate the difference in sales between each employee's current sale and their previous sale.


select employee_id,name ,sale.amount,
 sale.amount - LAG(sale.amount) OVER (PARTTION BY employee_id  ORDER BY sale.sale_date) as sale_diff

from employees AS emp

INNER join sales as sale ON sale.employee_id=emp.employee_id

order by emp.employee_id,
sale.sale_id

3)
Retrieve the average salary of employees in each department and the difference of each employee's salary from the department's average salary.




select emp.employee_id,emp.name ,emp.salary,dept.department_id,
 AVG(salary) OVER (PARITION BY employee_id  ORDER BY dept.department_id) as depart_diff,
 emp.salary =AVG(emp.salary) OVER (PARITION BY employee_id  ORDER BY dept.department_id) as sal_diff,
from employees AS emp
INNER join departments as dept ON dept.department_id=emp.department_id
order by emp.employee_id,
dept.department_id



4)Find the cumulative percentage of total sales amount for each employee.

select emp.employee_id,emp.name ,sale.amount,
sum(sale.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY emp.employee_id  ORDER BY sale.sale_date) as cum_sales,
 100 * sum(sale.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY  emp.employee_id  ORDER BY sale.sale_date) /
 sum(sale.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY  emp.employee_id ) as cum_percen
 
from employees AS emp

INNER join sales as sale ON sale.employee_id=emp.employee_id

order by emp.employee_id,
sale.sale_id

5)Retrieve the top 3 most expensive products in each category.


select  prd.product_id,prd.product_name,pr.price,
NUM_ROWS() OVER (PARTITION BY ord.order_id  ORDER BY prd.price) as top_three,


from products AS prd

INNER join orders as ord ON ord.product_id=products.product_id


where top_three < =3
order by ord.order_id,

6)
Calculate the year-to-date (YTD) sales for each employee.



select emp.employee_id,emp.name ,sum(sale.amount) as yr_sales,
from employees AS emp
INNER join sales as sale ON sale.employee_id=emp.employee_id
WHERE YEAR(sale.sale_date)=YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY  emp.employee_id


7)

Retrieve the sales of each employee as a percentage of the total sales in their department.

select emp.employee_id,emp.name ,sale.amount,dept.department_id,
100* sale.amount  / SUM(sale.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY dept.department_id) as sales_per,

from employees AS emp
INNER join sales as sale ON sale.employee_id=emp.employee_id

INNER join departmet as dept ON sale.department_id=emp.department_id
Group BY  emp.employee_id,sale.sale_date

Retrieve the name and total sales amount for the employee with the second highest total sales.


select emp.name ,sum(sale.amount) as total_sales_amount
100* sale.amount  / SUM(sale.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY dept.department_id) as sales_per,

from employees AS emp
INNER join sales as sale ON sale.employee_id=emp.employee_id

Group BY   emp.name
order by total_sales_amount DESC
OFFSET 1 ROW
